I am a chemical engineer graduated with emphasis in process modeling, simulation and optimization using Python. 
In the past months, I have been extensively studying data science and machine learning and I am looking to solve real life problems problems integrating my knowledge in engineer and data science.

Here you can find some of the work I did using Python to solve chemical engineering problems and more recently, data science and machine learning problems including supervised and unsupervised models. 

You can get in touch with me through my email or my LinkedIn page, both linked bellow.
